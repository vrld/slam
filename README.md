SLAM
====
... is the **Simple [LOVE] Audio Manager** formerly known as the **Benignly
Designed Sound Manager.** It's a minimally invasive augmentation of [LOVE]'s
audio module. In contrast to sources that can only have one simultaneous
playing instance, SLAM sources create *instances* when played. This way you can
play one source multiple times at once. Each instance will inherit the settings
(volume, speed, looping, ...) of it's SLAM source, but can override them.

SLAM also features tags, which can be used to modify a number of sources at the
same time.

Example
-------
```lua
require 'slam'
function love.load()
    music = love.audio.newSource('music.ogg', 'stream') -- creates a new SLAM source
    music:setLooping(true)                              -- all instances will be looping
    music:setVolume(.3)                                 -- set volume for all instances
    love.audio.play(music)                              -- play music

    
    woosh = love.audio.newSource({'woosh1.ogg', 'woosh2.ogg'}, 'static')
end

function love.keypressed()
    local instance = woosh:play()                       -- creates a new instance
    instance:setPitch(.5 + math.random() * .5)          -- set pitch for this instance only
end
```

### Operations on Sources
```lua
source = love.audio.newSource(what, how)
```
Returns a new SLAM source. Accepts the same parameters as
[love.audio.newSource](http://love2d.org/wiki/love.audio.newSource), with one
major difference: `what` can be a table, in which case each new playing
instance will pick an item of that table at random.

```lua
instance = love.audio.play(source)
instance = source:play()
```
Plays a source, removes all paused instances and returns a handle to the player
instance. Instances will inherit the settings (looping, pitch, volume) of
`source`.

```lua
love.audio.stop(source)
source:stop()
```
Stops all playing instances of a source.

```lua
love.audio.stop()
```
Stops all playing instances.

```lua
source:pause()
```
Pauses all playing instances of a source.

```lua
source:resume()
```
Resumes all paused instances of a source. **Note:** source:play() clears paused
instances from a paused source.

```lua
source:isStatic()
```
Returns `true` if the source is static, `false` otherwise.

```lua
looping = source:isLooping()
source:setLooping(looping)
pitch = source:getPitch()
source:setPitch(pitch)
volume = source:getVolume()
source:setVolume(volume)
```
Sets properties for all instances. Affects playing instances immediately. For
details on the parameters, see the [LOVE wiki](http://love2d.org/wiki/Source).


### Instances

All functions that affect LOVE Sources can be applied to SLAM instances. These
are:
```lua
love.audio.pause(instance)
instance:pause()
instance:isPaused()

love.audio.play(instance)
instance:play()

love.audio.resume(instance)
instance:resume()

love.audio.rewind(instance)
instance:rewind()

instance:getDirection()
instance:setDirection()

instance:getPitch()
instance:setPitch()

instance:getPosition()
instance:setPosition()

instance:getVelocity()
instance:setVelocity()

instance:getVolume()
instance:setVolume()

instance:isLooping()
instance:setLooping()
```
See the [LOVE wiki](http://love2d.org/wiki/Source) for details.


### Tags

With tags you can group several sources together and call functions upon them.
A simple example:
```lua
-- add some stuff to the background tag
drums:addTags('music')
baseline:addTags('background', 'music') -- a source can have multiple tags
muttering:addTags('background')
noise:addTags('background')
cars:addTags('background')

-- (...)

love.audio.tags.background.setVolume(0) -- mute all background sounds
love.audio.tags.music.setVolume(.1)     -- ... but keep the music alive
```

#### Functions
```lua
source:addTags(tag, ...)
```
Adds one or more tags to a source. By default, all sources are member of the
tag `all`.

```lua
source:removeTags(tag, ...)
```
Remove one or more tags from a source.

```lua
love.audio.tags.TAG.FUNCTION(...)
love.audio.tags[TAG].FUNCTION(...)
```
Calls `FUNCTION` on all sources tagged with `TAG`.
